# EVCSS_website
I am developing a website to enhance and refine my HTML skills. This project is not a school assignment but is inspired by a project from one of my computer science classes.
Currently, I have created a simple prototype website for the EVCSS project, which is envisioned to include multiple websites in the future. The prototype is a single HTML file.
